# Python Tutorial Journey üêç

## Introduction  
Welcome!  
I created this repository to **recap my own Python knowledge** and also to **share with anyone who is starting to learn Python**.  
The idea is to provide a simple learning path where learners can **download the files** and **run them step-by-step** to see how the codes work in action.

## üìÇ Repository Structure  
The repository is organized to help you progress gradually:  

1. **`Basic/`**  
   - Covers Python fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, etc.).  
2. **`Intermediate/`**  
   - Introduces more complex concepts (OOP, file handling, error handling, etc.).  
3. **`Advance/`**  
   - Demonstrates practical applications, including the use of **Data Science libraries** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.).
